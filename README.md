# Storytelling-Data-Visualization-on-Exchange-Rates
In this latest project, "Narrative Economics: Visualizing Currency Exchange Dynamics," I delve into the art of explanatory data visualization. This work aims to guide the audience through the subtle intricacies and broader trends of the Euro-USD exchange rate across different US presidencies. Utilizing principles of information design, such as familiarity and data-ink optimization, and storytelling elements within Matplotlib, I create visuals that are not only informative but also engaging. I explore how pre-attentive attributes can direct attention, and I analyze the moving average to present the data's long-term tendencies over daily fluctuations. Notably, the project features a critical examination of the Euro's strength against the USD during the presidencies of Bush, Obama, and Trump, underscoring the factors beyond political leadership that influence economic indicators. This project underscores the storytelling power embedded in data visualization and the narratives that shape our understanding of economic phenomena.
